# TURBO: Target-Augmented Shared Fusion-based Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation

## Overview

This project is an independent implementation of the paper:
**[Target-Augmented Shared Fusion-based Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07391)**  
by Palaash Goel, Dushyant Singh Chauhan, and Md Shad Akhtar.

This work addresses the task of **Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation Generation**, where a model is required not only to detect sarcasm but also to explain it using both text and image inputs. TURBO (Target-Augmented Shared Fusion) enhances explanation generation by identifying sarcasm targets and leveraging fusion mechanisms between modalities.

## Contents of `turbo.ipynb`

The notebook is organized into the following key sections:

### 1. **Data Preparation**

- Loads the extended MORE+ dataset containing sarcastic posts and their explanations.
- Parses input modalities:
  - Textual captions
  - Image features
  - Annotated sarcasm targets
- Preprocesses the data into the input format for training and evaluation.

### 2. **Core Architecture**

- Defines the TURBO model with:
  - A modified BART encoder
  - Cross-attention layers to fuse image features
  - A sarcasm-target-aware representation
- Image features are handled using extracted Vision Transformer (ViT) embeddings or object detection scores.

### 3. **Training Pipeline**

- Loads training and validation splits from the dataset.
- Compiles the model using standard loss functions for sequence generation.
- Trains TURBO using teacher forcing and sequence-level supervision.
- Logs intermediate loss and performance metrics.

### 4. **Evaluation System**

- Evaluates model on the test split using BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores.
- Visualizes explanations alongside sarcasm targets.
- Includes examples of both correct and incorrect generations with analysis.

## Installation

## Dataset
The MORE+ dataset is a publicly available extension of the Multimodal Opinion-based Reasoning (MORE) dataset.
It includes sarcasm targets that enhance model interpretability.
If you do not have the dataset, refer to the original paper for access or reproduce the format.
